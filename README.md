# mpv-timestamp-tracker-lua-scripts
collection of lua scripts for mpv to keep track of anime series or dramas

all of the timestamps are stored in the "${HOME}/.local/state/" directory where timestamps will be stored in files named after the media-title property & will be stored in the format "\<episode number\> - \<seconds\>"

### what works:
  - can track anime series played from the "ani-cli" script or from downloaded playlist (all episodes need to have the format "\<anime-name\> - Episode \<number\>") <br>
 
### what needs to be worked on
  - timestamp tracking drama series
